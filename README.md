This repository contains my solution to the Software Engineering 1 lab test from the second year of my Computer Science studies at TU Dublin.

# Project Overview

This project implements a **Library Management System** using UML modeling to manage books, copies, and members efficiently. Key features include:

- **Books**: Each book has attributes like title and author, with methods for borrowing and returning.
- **Copies**: Tracks the status of individual book copies (available, on loan, reserved) and supports borrowing and returning operations.
- **Members**: Manages member details and borrowing logic, ensuring adherence to borrowing limits.
